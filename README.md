Orbit is a set of independent utilities around NATS ecosystem that aims to boost
productivity and provide higher abstraction layer for NATS clients.

Note that these libraries will evolve rapidly and API guarantees are not made
until the specific project has a v1.0.0 version.

You can <!--use the library as a whole, or-->pick just what you need.
